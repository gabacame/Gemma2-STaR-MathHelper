# Calculus I Notes

## 1. Introduction

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous change. It is a powerful tool used in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and biology.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Limits:** The foundation of calculus. Limits describe the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value.
* **Derivatives:** Measure the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
* **Integrals:** Calculate the area under a curve and represent the accumulation of a quantity.

## 2. Limits

**Definition:**

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$, denoted as $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$, means that the value of $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $a$ (but not equal to $a$).

**Types of Limits:**

* **One-sided limits:** Limits from the left ($\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$) or the right ($\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$).
* **Infinite limits:** Limits where the function approaches positive or negative infinity as $x$ approaches a certain value.

**Limit Laws:**

* **Sum Law:** $\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) + g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) + \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$
* **Product Law:** $\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \cdot \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$
* **Quotient Law:** $\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) / g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) / \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$, provided $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) \neq 0$

**Example:**

Find $\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 + 3x)$.

Using the sum and product laws:

$$\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 + 3x) = \lim_{x \to 2} x^2 + \lim_{x \to 2} 3x = 2^2 + 3(2) = 10$$

## 3. Continuity

**Definition:**

A function $f(x)$ is continuous at a point $x = a$ if:

1. $f(a)$ is defined.
2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.

**Types of Discontinuities:**

* **Removable discontinuities:** Can be "fixed" by redefining the function at that point.
* **Jump discontinuities:** The function jumps from one value to another at the point of discontinuity.
* **Infinite discontinuities:** The function approaches infinity at the point of discontinuity.

**Example:**

The function $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$ has a removable discontinuity at $x = 1$.

## 4. Derivatives

**Definition:**

The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x = a$, denoted as $f'(a)$, is the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ at $x = a$. It is defined as:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$

**Geometric Interpretation:**

The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ at the point $(a, f(a))$.

**Differentiation Rules:**

* **Power Rule:** $\frac{d}{dx} (x^n) = nx^{n-1}$
* **Product Rule:** $\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$
* **Quotient Rule:** $\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)/g(x)] = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$
* **Chain Rule:** $\frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$

**Example:**

Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 + 2x$.

Using the power rule:

$$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2$$

## 5. Applications of Derivatives

**Applications:**

* **Finding critical points:** Points where the derivative is zero or undefined.
* **Determining intervals of increase and decrease:** Where the derivative is positive or negative.
* **Finding local maxima and minima:** Where the derivative changes sign.
* **Optimization problems:** Finding the maximum or minimum values of a function.
* **Related rates:** Finding the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.

**Example:**

Find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2$.

$$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x = 3x(x - 2)$$

Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we get $x = 0$ and $x = 2$. These are the critical points.

## 6. Implicit Differentiation

**Definition:**

A technique used to find the derivative of a function that is defined implicitly, meaning it is not explicitly solved for $y$.

**Steps:**

1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.
2. Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

**Example:**

Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.

Differentiating both sides:

$$2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$

Solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$$

## 7. Integration

**Definition:**

The integral of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, denoted as $\int f(x) dx$, represents the area under the curve of $f(x)$.

**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**

The fundamental theorem of calculus connects differentiation and integration:

* **Part 1:** If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then:

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

* **Part 2:** If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then:

$$\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)$$

**Integration Techniques:**

* **Substitution:** Replacing part of the integrand with a new variable.
* **Integration by parts:** A technique for integrating products of functions.
* **Partial fractions:** Decomposing a rational function into simpler fractions.

**Example:**

Find $\int (x^2 + 1) dx$.

Using the power rule of integration:

$$\int (x^2 + 1) dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + x + C$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration.

## 8. Applications of Integration

**Applications:**

* **Finding area:** Calculating the area between curves.
* **Finding volume:** Calculating the volume of solids of revolution.
* **Calculating work:** Determining the work done by a force.
* **Solving differential equations:** Finding functions that satisfy a given equation involving derivatives.

**Example:**

Find the area of the region bounded by the curves $y = x^2$ and $y = 4$.

The area is given by:

$$\int_{-2}^2 (4 - x^2) dx = \left[ 4x - \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{-2}^2 = \frac{32}{3}$$

## 9. Series

**Definition:**

A series is the sum of an infinite number of terms.

**Types of Series:**

* **Geometric series:** Each term is a constant multiple of the previous term.
* **Power series:** Each term is a power of a variable.
* **Taylor series:** Represents a function as an infinite sum of terms involving its derivatives.

**Convergence and Divergence:**

A series is said to converge if its sum approaches a finite value. Otherwise, it diverges.

**Tests for Convergence:**

* **Ratio Test:** Determines convergence based on the ratio of consecutive terms.
* **Integral Test:** Compares the series to an integral.
* **Comparison Test:** Compares the series to another series whose convergence is known.

**Example:**

Find the sum of the infinite geometric series:

$$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ...$$

The sum of a geometric series is given by:

$$S = \frac{a}{1 - r}$$

where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.

In this case, $a = 1$ and $r = \frac{1}{2}$, so the sum is:

$$S = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2$$

## 10. Differential Equations

**Definition:**

A differential equation is an equation that relates a function to its derivatives.

**Types of Differential Equations:**

* **Ordinary differential equations (ODEs):** Involve only ordinary derivatives.
* **Partial differential equations (PDEs):** Involve partial derivatives.

**Solving Differential Equations:**

* **Separation of variables:** Isolating the dependent variable and its derivative on opposite sides of the equation.
* **Integrating factors:** Multiplying both sides of the equation by a suitable function to make it integrable.
* **Method of undetermined coefficients:** Guessing a solution and plugging it into the equation to solve for the coefficients.

**Example:**

Solve the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = y$.

Separating variables:

$$\frac{dy}{y} = dx$$

Integrating both sides:

$$\ln|y| = x + C$$

Solving for $y$:

$$y = Ce^x$$

where $C$ is a constant.

## 11. Applications of Differential Equations

**Applications:**

* **Modeling population growth:** Describing the rate of change of a population over time.
* **Modeling radioactive decay:** Describing the rate of decay of a radioactive substance.
* **Modeling circuits:** Describing the behavior of electrical circuits.
* **Modeling heat transfer:** Describing the flow of heat through a material.

**Example:**

The population of a certain city is modeled by the differential equation $\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$, where $P$ is the population, $t$ is time, and $k$ is a constant.

The solution to this differential equation is:

$$P = P_0 e^{kt}$$

where $P_0$ is the initial population.

## Calculus II Notes

Building upon the foundations of Calculus I, Calculus II delves deeper into the concepts of integration, introduces new techniques for solving integrals, and explores applications of calculus in various fields.

## 1. Techniques of Integration

* **Integration by Parts:** A powerful technique for integrating products of functions.  
    * The formula is: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du
    * Key is choosing u and dv strategically.

**Example:** Find ∫ x cos(x) dx.

* Let u = x, dv = cos(x) dx
* Then du = dx, v = sin(x)
* Applying the formula: ∫ x cos(x) dx = x sin(x) - ∫ sin(x) dx = x sin(x) + cos(x) + C

* **Trigonometric Integrals:** Techniques for integrating expressions involving trigonometric functions.  
    * Common strategies include using trigonometric identities, substitution, and integration by parts.

**Example:** Find ∫ sin^2(x) cos(x) dx.

* Use the substitution u = sin(x), du = cos(x) dx
* Then ∫ sin^2(x) cos(x) dx = ∫ u^2 du = (u^3)/3 + C = (sin^3(x))/3 + C

* **Trigonometric Substitution:**  A technique used to simplify integrals involving square roots and quadratic expressions.  
    * The substitution involves using trigonometric identities to express the integral in terms of trigonometric functions.

**Example:** Find ∫ √(4 - x^2) dx.

* Substitute x = 2 sin(θ), dx = 2 cos(θ) dθ
* Then ∫ √(4 - x^2) dx = ∫ √(4 - 4 sin^2(θ)) 2 cos(θ) dθ = 4 ∫ cos^2(θ) dθ
* Use the double-angle formula: cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2
* Solving the integral yields: 2θ + sin(2θ) + C.  Substitute back for θ using arcsin(x/2) to obtain the final answer.

* **Partial Fractions:** A technique for integrating rational functions (fractions of polynomials).  
    * Decompose the rational function into simpler fractions, which can be easily integrated.

**Example:** Find ∫ (x + 2)/(x^2 + 3x + 2) dx.

* Factor the denominator: (x + 2)/(x + 1)(x + 2)
* Decompose: (x + 2)/(x + 1)(x + 2) = A/(x + 1) + B/(x + 2)
* Solve for A and B: A = 1, B = -1
* Integrate each term: ∫ 1/(x + 1) dx - ∫ 1/(x + 2) dx = ln|x + 1| - ln|x + 2| + C

## 2. Improper Integrals

* **Integrals with Discontinuities:** Integrals where the integrand has a discontinuity within the interval of integration.  
    * Evaluate using limits as the variable approaches the point of discontinuity.

**Example:** Find ∫_0^1 (1/√x) dx.

* The integrand has a discontinuity at x = 0.
* ∫_0^1 (1/√x) dx = lim_(a→0+) ∫_a^1 (1/√x) dx = lim_(a→0+) (2√x)|_a^1 = 2

* **Volumes of Solids of Revolution:**  Calculate the volume of a solid generated by revolving a region around an axis.  
    * Utilize the disk method, washer method, or shell method depending on the shape of the region and the axis of rotation.

**Example:** Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by y = x^2 and y = 4 around the x-axis.

* Using the disk method: V = π ∫_0^2 (4^2 - (x^2)^2) dx = (128π)/3

* **Arc Length:**  Calculate the length of a curve.

**Example:** Find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 1.

* Arc length = ∫_0^1 √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx = ∫_0^1 √(1 + (3/2)x^(1/2))^2 dx = (8/27)(10√10 - 1)

* **Surface Area:**  Calculate the surface area of a solid of revolution.

**Example:** Find the surface area of the solid generated by revolving the curve y = √x from x = 0 to x = 1 around the x-axis.

* Surface area = 2π ∫_0^1 y √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx = 2π ∫_0^1 √x √(1 + (1/(4x))) dx = (π/6)(5√5 - 1)

## 4. Sequences and Series

    * Allow for more flexible and complex curves compared to standard functions.

**Example:** The parametric equations x = cos(t), y = sin(t) represent a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.

* **Polar Coordinates:**  Represent points in the plane using distance from the origin (r) and an angle (θ).  
    * Useful for describing curves that have radial symmetry.

* Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor: e^(2x) y' + 2e^(2x) y = e^(3x).
* The left side is the derivative of e^(2x) y.
* Integrating both sides: e^(2x) y = (1/3)e^(3x) + C.
* Solving for y: y = (1/3)e^x + Ce^(-2x).

* **Applications of Differential Equations:**  Model real-world phenomena such as population growth, radioactive decay, and circuit analysis.

**Example:** The growth of a population is modeled by the differential equation dP/dt = kP, where P is the population, t is time, and k is a constant.

    * Example:  y' + 2y = sin(x) 
* **Order:**  The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest derivative present. 
    * Example: y'' + 3y' - 2y = 0 is a second-order differential equation.
* **Linear vs. Nonlinear:**  
    * **Linear:**  All terms involving the unknown function and its derivatives are linear (no powers, products, or other nonlinear combinations).
    * **Nonlinear:**  Contains nonlinear terms involving the unknown function or its derivatives.

### 2. Solving Differential Equations: A Toolbox

* **Separable Equations:**  Can be rewritten so that terms involving the independent and dependent variables are separated on opposite sides of the equation.
    * **Procedure:** Separate, integrate, solve for the unknown function.
    * **Example:** dy/dx = xy.  Separate to get dy/y = x dx, integrate both sides to get ln|y| = x^2/2 + C, solve for y: y = Ce^(x^2/2).

* **Linear First-Order Equations:**  Can be written in the form y' + p(x)y = q(x).
    * **Procedure:** Find an integrating factor, multiply both sides by the integrating factor, integrate, solve for y.
    * **Example:** y' + 2y = e^x.  Integrating factor: e^(∫2 dx) = e^(2x).  Multiply both sides by e^(2x), integrate, solve for y: y = (1/3)e^x + Ce^(-2x).

* **Second-Order Linear Homogeneous Equations:**  Have the form ay'' + by' + cy = 0.
    * **Procedure:** Find the characteristic equation (ar^2 + br + c = 0), solve for r, use the roots to construct the general solution.
    * **Example:** y'' - 4y' + 4y = 0.  Characteristic equation: r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0, r = 2 (double root).  General solution: y = C1e^(2x) + C2xe^(2x).

* **Higher-Order Linear Homogeneous Equations:**  Similar to the second-order case, but involve higher-order derivatives. 
    * **Procedure:** Find the characteristic equation, solve for roots, construct the general solution (may involve complex roots or repeated roots).

* **Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations:**  Have the form ay'' + by' + cy = f(x) (where f(x) is a non-zero function).
    * **Procedure:** Find the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation (ay'' + by' + cy = 0), then find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation (using methods like undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters), add the two solutions together.

* **Numerical Methods:**  Used when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to find. 
    * **Examples:** Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods.
